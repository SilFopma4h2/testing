Patte Conservation Initiative

This file marks the transition to cryptocurrency-only donations for the Hope Foundation.
As part of our conservation efforts and commitment to modern payment methods, 
we now exclusively accept donations through Bitcoin and Ethereum.

All donations will be automatically notified to our Discord channel for 
transparency and immediate acknowledgment.

Thank you for supporting our conservation mission through cryptocurrency.
