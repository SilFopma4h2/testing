                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Community-driven marine conservation - the story of Patte Conservation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <div class="card">
                            <h3>Community Formation</h3>
                            <p>Patte Conservation was formed as a Community-Based Organization (CBO) consisting of 10 dedicated members from three villages: 3 from Shanga Ishakani village, 3 from Shanga Rubu village, and 4 from Pate village. This collaborative initiative emerged from the shared need to conserve marine ecosystems.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Recognizing the Challenge</h3>
                            <p>Our communities, which mostly depend on marine resources for their livelihoods, recognized that human population growth was increasing while marine production was decreasing. This realization drove us to seek sustainable solutions for resource management.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Partnership with Ocean Trust</h3>
                            <p>We formed a vital partnership with The Ocean Trust Organization to enhance our coral reef restoration efforts. This collaboration ensures that restoration is community-driven, with local people at the heart of every activity.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Current Initiatives</h3>
                            <p>Today, we actively manage the Iweni Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA), focusing on coral restoration, environmental conservation awareness, and eco-tourism activities including snorkeling, diving, and sea adventures.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Future Vision</h3>
                            <p>Our future plans include expanding advocacy on marine life conservation, mangrove restoration, and seaweed planting to create a more resilient and productive marine ecosystem for generations to come.</p>
