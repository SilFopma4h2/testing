                            <h3>2015 - Foundation Established</h3>
                            <p>Hope Foundation was founded by a group of passionate individuals who wanted to address educational inequality in their local community. Starting with a single school project, they raised $15,000 to build a classroom for 30 children.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">2017 - First International Project</h3>
                            <p>Recognizing the global need for educational support, we launched our first international project in Kenya, building three schools and training 25 local teachers. This marked our expansion beyond local borders.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">2019 - Healthcare Initiative Launch</h3>
                            <p>We expanded our mission to include healthcare services, establishing mobile clinics in remote areas and providing basic medical care to over 10,000 people in our first year.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">2021 - Clean Water Program</h3>
                            <p>Launched our clean water initiative, recognizing that access to safe drinking water is fundamental to health and education. We've since provided clean water access to over 25 communities.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">2023 - Digital Innovation</h3>
                            <p>Introduced technology-based learning solutions and digital literacy programs, helping bridge the digital divide in underserved communities worldwide.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">2025 - Present Day</h3>
