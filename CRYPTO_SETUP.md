# Crypto Donation Setup Instructions

## Overview
The donation system has been successfully modified to only accept cryptocurrency donations (Bitcoin and Ethereum). When donations are submitted, notifications are sent to a Discord channel via webhook.

## Required Configuration

### 1. Discord Webhook Setup
1. Create a Discord server or use an existing one
2. Go to Server Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ Webhooks
3. Click "New Webhook" or "Create Webhook"
4. Choose the channel where donation notifications should appear
5. Copy the webhook URL

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:

```bash
# Flask Configuration
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///ngo.db

# Mail Configuration (optional)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=noreply@hopefoundation.org

# Discord Webhook Configuration
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE
```

### 3. Update Crypto Wallet Addresses

**IMPORTANT**: Replace the placeholder wallet addresses with your actual cryptocurrency addresses.

**Current placeholder addresses to replace:**

**Bitcoin Address (in both files):**
- Current: `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`
- Replace in: `app.py` (line ~606) and `donate.html` (line ~257, 366)

**Ethereum Address (in both files):**
- Current: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D9f9f9f`
- Replace in: `app.py` (line ~607) and `donate.html` (line ~259, 368)

### 4. Files to Update with Your Addresses

#### app.py
```python
# Around line 605-608
crypto_addresses = {
    'bitcoin': 'YOUR_ACTUAL_BITCOIN_ADDRESS_HERE',
    'ethereum': 'YOUR_ACTUAL_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS_HERE'
}
```

#### donate.html
```html
<!-- Around line 257 and 366 -->
<small>YOUR_ACTUAL_BITCOIN_ADDRESS_HERE</small>
<small>YOUR_ACTUAL_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS_HERE</small>

<!-- In JavaScript around line 383 and 387 -->
cryptoAddress.textContent = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_BITCOIN_ADDRESS_HERE';
cryptoAddress.textContent = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS_HERE';
```

## Features Implemented

âœ… **Crypto-Only Donations**: Only Bitcoin and Ethereum accepted
âœ… **Dynamic UI**: Shows wallet address when payment method is selected
âœ… **Backend Validation**: Rejects non-crypto payment methods
âœ… **Discord Integration**: Rich embed notifications with donation details
âœ… **Email Notifications**: Updated templates with crypto instructions
âœ… **Database Storage**: All donation details saved with transaction IDs

## Discord Notification Format

When donations are submitted, Discord will receive rich embed notifications containing:
- ðŸ’° Donation Amount
- ðŸª™ Cryptocurrency Type
- ðŸŽ¯ Selected Project
- ðŸ‘¤ Donor Information (respects anonymous setting)
- ðŸ”— Transaction ID
- ðŸ’Œ Donor Message (if provided)

## Testing

The system has been tested and verified to work correctly:
- âœ… Form validation works
- âœ… Crypto payment methods display correctly
- âœ… Non-crypto payments are rejected
- âœ… Database records created properly
- âœ… Discord webhook ready (needs URL configuration)

## Next Steps

1. Configure your Discord webhook URL in the `.env` file
2. Replace placeholder crypto addresses with your actual wallet addresses
3. Test with small donations to verify everything works correctly
4. Monitor Discord notifications to ensure proper operation

**Security Note**: Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control. The `.env.example` file is provided as a template.
